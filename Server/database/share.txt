Overview
Development teams often need to quickly share code snippets or other short notes with each
other during their daily works. We need to develop a platform called “Shared Clipboard” to
provide these facilities for team members. This project will involve creating a server program
and a client program. Server will be installed in a server machine, while the clients will be
installed in PCs used by developers.
The platform must support multiple users at a time; in other words, the platform must support
multithreading.
It must have a specific communication protocol so that clients can ask for services following
rules.
Developers will be able to use the client program to upload/share notes and read notes
contributed by others. The server will keep track of which user is sharing which notes by
tagging each note with the IP address and port number of the client program.
We will use in-memory data structures to store the notes; no persistent storage is necessary at
this time.
The server will manage 3 channels for three categories of notes - one for python, one for
software testing, and the last one for database related notes.
The channels are named as follows - PY, QA and DB. Channel names are 2 characters long.
Each channel will hold notes for the topic it is for. So you will have to manage three in-memory
data structures to hold the notes.
The server must use utf-8 encoding to store notes.
